      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUID reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUID is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample is a subset of the households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey. 

From 1996-2017, DUID is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANEL to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUID begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUID can be combined with PID to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit. Please see the user note for more information on the relationship between Dwelling Units, families, Reporting Units, and persons.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, PID is a within-Dwelling Unit (DU) person identifier assigned in sampling or by the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) instrument. PID must be combined with DUID and PANEL to uniquely identify persons across all MEPS data. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID, created by concatenating the values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, MEPSID is a variable that uniquely identifies respondents across MEPS panels. It is created by combining PANEL, DUID, and PID. IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSID for the 1996-2017 samples to provide a single, universal linking key for MEPS persons. Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUID and DUPERSID (which combines DUID with PID) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANEL to the first two columns. This update makes DUPERSID identical to MEPSID in the IPUMS MEPS extract system for 2018-forward.

In earlier versions of IPUMS MEPS, IPUMS MEPS staff created a slightly different version of MEPSID, equivalent to combining DUID, PID, and PANEL. This version has been renamed to MEPSID2 and is only available for 1996-2017.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, PANEL reports the number of the panel of which the person was a member. MEPS began in 1996 with Panel number 1 and the panel number for persons entering the MEPS in each subsequent year increases by 1, so that 1997 had Panels 1 (the panel that entered in 1996, in their second year in 1997) and 2 (the panel newly entering MEPS in 1997), 1998 had Panels 2 and 3, 1999 had Panels 3 and 4, and so on. PANEL can be combined with DUID and PID to uniquely identify individuals across panels. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID that is equal to the concatenated values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

      <txt><![CDATA[PSUPLD is the pooled variance primary sampling unit variable that represents the impact of the sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use PSUPLD instead of the annual primary sampling unit (PSUANN) if the years included in a pooled analysis include survey year 2001 or earlier. When pooling data from only 2002 and later, use the variable PSUANN, the annual stratum variable for each survey year.

For analysis, researchers need to use PSUPLD in conjunction with STRATAPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data. 
&nbsp;PSUPLD should be used when analysts wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled. The use of PSUPLD and STRAPLD is necessary to obtain appropriate standard errors by specifying a common variance structure.]]></txt>

This weight should be used for many cross-sectional analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. 

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly when analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire or the Diabetes Care Survey, or when conducting longitudinal analyses with the MEPS data. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire from 2000 forward should use SAQWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population aged 18 and older. SAQWEIGHT adjusts for SAQ non-response.

In 2000, SAQWEIGHT also includes weighting information for children under the age of 18 whose parent or guardian completed the Parent Administered Questionnaire (PAQ). For 2000 only, the sum of SAQWEIGHT is equal to the full civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. SAQWEIGHT does differ from PERWEIGHT in 2000 because the poststratification age group of 15-19 was partitioned into two groups, 15-17 and 18-19, for SAQWEIGHT to account for the target populations of the SAQ and PAQ.

      <txt><![CDATA[SUPP1WT is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable for use in analyses of variables collected for both SAQ-eligible adults and for children in the Child Preventive Health supplement.

In the MEPS, there are a series of questions about health care access and utilization that are asked on the SAQ that are also asked on the Child Preventive Health supplement. An analysis of those variables would require users to employ SAQWEIGHT for cases where the response was collected on the SAQ and PERWEIGHT for cases where the response was collected on the Child Preventive Health supplement. To allow users to analyze these variables more easily across both questionnaires, IPUMS MEPS staff created SUPP1WT. For persons who were ages 18 and older in Round 2 or 4, SUPP1WT is the same as SAQWEIGHT. For persons who were ages 0 to 17 in Round 2 or 4, SUPP1WT is the same as PERWEIGHT.

See SAQELIG for more information on the SAQ and LESSHLTHY for more information on the Child Preventive Health supplement.

Collection of information on SEX in MEPS&nbsp;Data on the sex of each reporting unit (RU) member was determined during the NHIS interview, and was then verified, and, if necessary, corrected during each MEPS interview.

If the respondent was a new RU member or their sex was not ascertained in the NHIS interview, MEPS initially used the first name of the respondent to assign their sex. If the first name gave no clear indication of sex, the reported family relationships were used to assign sex. If the sex of the respondent was still unclear, sex was randomly assigned. 

The NHIS method of ascertaining the sex of the respondent, which primarily informs the MEPS version of SEX, is similar to the MEPS method. First, sex of the respondent was inferred from the individual's first name or family relationships. If the sex of the respondent was unclear, the interviewer was instructed to explicitly ask the person's sex. Beginning in 1998, interviewers were told to "enter your best guess" when the respondent either did not know or refused to answer the direct question that was asked about the person's sex.]]></txt>

IPUMS MEPS reports the universe for each variable based on a thorough review of the original MEPS documentation. Investigating the data may reveal cases that do not meet the stated universe. Users are encouraged to validate universes for their analyses.

In 2002 and 2003, YRSINUSG was asked of all persons eligible for the Access to Care section (ACCESSELIG) who were not born in the U.S. (USBORN). The Access to Care section gathers information on usual source of care for all family members, characteristics of usual source of care health providers, and barriers family members have faced in obtaining needed healthcare. From 2002-2013, the Access to Care section also collected information about language and nativity status. Beginning in 2013, YRSINUSG was moved to the Demographic section. Persons in Panel 17 were not asked YRSINUSG in 2013. Instead, their 2012 response to the Access to Care question YRSINUSC was recoded to a grouped year estimated and copied to the 2013 file, and persons in Panel 18 were asked YRSINUSG in the Demographic section.

Please see LANGSPEAK for information about the language and nativity variables in the Access to Care section and ACCESSELIG for more information on the Access to Care section as a whole.]]></txt>

EDUC is available for all survey participants age 5 and older at the time of their first MEPS interview. It is an IPUMS MEPS constructed variable. 

See Comparability section for more information on the construction of EDUC.

Education Variables offered through IPUMS MEPS&nbsp;In addition to EDUC, there are several other educational attainment variables offered through MEPS. Unlike EDUC, these variables are not available for every MEPS year.

EDUCYR: Years of education completed (available 1996-2011 and 2014 forward)

HIDEG: Highest degree completed (available 1996-2011 and 2014 forward)

EDUYRDG: Years of education and highest degree completed (available 2011-2015)

      <labl>CPS family income as a percentage of the poverty line, original data, categorical</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[POVCAT is a categorical variable reporting family income as a percentage of the poverty line.

POVCAT uses family income and CPS family size. CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Family income is constructed using person-level total income, comprised of: annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions;  business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and workman's compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Family income excluded tax refunds and capital gains.  

Person-level income totals were then summed over family members as defined by CPSFAMID to yield the family-level total.  POVCAT is constructed by dividing family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition), with the resulting percentages grouped into the following 5 categories: 
1. Negative or poor (LT 100% poverty line) 
2. Near poor (100-124% poverty line) 
3. Low income (125-199% poverty line 
4. Middle income (200-399% poverty line) 
5. High income (GE 400% poverty line)

Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVCAT.

Logical editing or weighted, sequential hot-deck imputation were used to impute income amounts for missing values (both for non-response and for persons in the full-year file who were not in the round where income questions were asked). Round-level data on employment status, hours worked, and wages were used to supplement earnings data collected in the Income Section. 

A continuous variable POVLEV for the ratio of total family income to federal poverty line is also available beginning in 2007. An IPUMS MEPS constructed variable (POVCATCPS) offers CPS family income to poverty level ratio data in more detailed categories, for all survey years. POVLEV and POVCPSCAT calculate family income to poverty level ratios for the CPS family (excludes foster children and unmarried partners). Additionally, an IPUMS MEPS constructed variable (POVCATMEPS) is available for all survey years, and contains more detailed poverty line ratio categories for MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). POVCATCPS and POVCATMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income (summed across MEPS family), and therefore may not match POVCAT.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[POVLEV is a continuous measure of the ratio of total family income (excluding capital gains and tax refunds) to the federal poverty line. AHRQ staff constructed POVLEV primarily from data collected in the Income section of the MEPS questionnaire, by dividing CPS family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition).

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS-defined family, the CPS family definition does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Family income was constructed by first creating person-level total income, comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, and commissions (INCWAGE); business and farm gains and losses (INCBUS); unemployment (INCUNEMP) and workers' compensation (INCWKCOM); interest (INCINT) and dividends (INCDIVID); alimony (INCALIM), child support (INCCHLD), and other private cash transfers (INCCASH); private pensions (INCRETIR), IRA withdrawals (INCIRA), social security (INCSS), and veterans payments (INCVET); supplemental security income (INCSSI) and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children (INCWELFR); gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties (INCPROP and INCTRST); and a small amount of "other" income (INCOTH). Family income excluded tax refunds and capital gains.  

Person-level income totals were then summed over family members as defined by CPSFAMID to yield the family-level total. Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVLEV.

Logical editing or weighted, sequential hot-deck imputation were used to impute income amounts for missing values (both for non-response and for persons in the full-year file who were not in the round where income questions were asked). Round-level data on employment status, hours worked, and wages were used to supplement earnings data collected in the Income Section. 

A categorical variable POVCAT for the ratio of total family income to federal poverty line is also available in all survey years. Two categorical IPUMS MEPS constructed variables are also available. (POVCATCPS) and (POVCATMEPS) offer family income to poverty level ratio data in more detailed categories, for all survey years. POVCAT and POVCPSCAT calculate family income to poverty level ratios for the CPS family (excludes foster children and unmarried partners). POVCATMEPS uses MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). POVCATCPS and POVCATMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income (summed across MEPS family), and therefore may not match POVCAT.]]></txt>

Beginning in 2018 VISITYRNO is fielded every other year and will only be collected in odd years. See our user note for more details on this and other changes that occurred in 2018.

IPUMS MEPS reports the universe for each variable based on a thorough review of the original MEPS documentation. Investigating the data may reveal cases that do not meet the stated universe. Users are encouraged to validate universes for their analyses.

Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems&nbsp;VISITYRNO is part of the health plan version of Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). CAHPS is a family of survey instruments sponsored by AHRQ that are designed to measure patient experience with health care by assessing whether actions that should happen in a health care setting actually happened and how often they happened. For more information on the CAHPS survey instruments, please see AHRQ's website. In addition to VISITYRNO, other questions included on the MEPS from CAHPS are:

ADRTCR: Made appt for non-emergency medical care: last 12 months

This variable was constructed by AHRQ staff based on the values of the corresponding 12 month-by-month Medicaid health insurance coverage variables (MAJA-MADE).

Definitions&nbsp;Family respondents were asked about public assistance, Medicaid, or SCHIP coverage during the Health Insurance portion of the questionnaire. Respondents were asked "Let's talk (again) about all the health insurance coverage the family may have to help pay for the costs of medical care (since {START DATE}/between {START DATE} and {END DATE}}." Respondents were prompted to retrieve any insurance cards or identifying information to help answer questions about health insurance coverage. 

Respondents were asked "{Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME} are state programs that pay for health care for persons in need. People covered by {Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME} may have a (piece of paper/card) that looks something like this.

At any time {since {START DATE}/between {START DATE} and {END DATE}}, has anyone in the family been covered by {Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME}?" If respondents needed more explanation of Medicaid or SCHIP, they were told:

"Medicaid is a federally-assisted, state-administered program that offers health benefits to low income persons on public assistance. The program also may cover the aged, the blind, and the disabled who are in financial need. Medicaid may be known by different names in different states.

The Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a program which gives each state permission to offer health insurance for children, up to age 19, who are not already insured and for uninsured families with limited income and resources who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. SCHIP is a state administered program and may be known by different names in different states."]]></txt>

Payments for over-the-counter drugs and indirect payments not related to specific medical events, such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share and Medicare Direct Medical Education subsidies, are not included in this amount. 

AHRQ staff advise users to exercise caution when interpreting the expenditures recorded in EXPOPRPAY. While these payments stem from apparent inconsistent responses to the health insurance and source of payment questions in the survey, some of these inconsistencies may have logical explanations. For example, private insurance coverage in MEPS is defined as having a major medical plan covering hospital and physician services. If a MEPS sample person did not have such coverage but had a single service type insurance plan (e.g., dental insurance) that paid for a particular episode of care, those payments may be classified as "other private."

      <labl>Rating of all health care received: last 12 months</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For SAQ persons ages 18 and older and children ages 0 to 17 who went to a doctor's office or clinic in the past 12 months, excluding emergency room visits (VISITYRNO), ADHECR indicates how the respondent would rate all of their health care in the last 12 months. The respondent rated their health care experience on a scale from zero to ten, where zero is the worst health care possible, and ten is the best health care possible.

Beginning in 2018 ADHECR is fielded every other year and will only be collected in odd years. See our user note for more details on this and other changes that occurred in 2018.

IPUMS MEPS reports the universe for each variable based on a thorough review of the original MEPS documentation. Investigating the data may reveal cases that do not meet the stated universe. Users are encouraged to validate universes for their analyses.

ADHECR is part of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). See VISITYRNO for more information on CAHPS.

For adults ages 18 and older, ADHECR is part of the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ), a pencil-and-paper survey. See SAQELIG for more information on the SAQ.

For children ages 0 to 17, ADHECR was asked on the Parent Administered Questionnaire, a pencil-and-paper survey, in 2000. For 2001 forward, ADHECR is part of the Child Preventive Health Supplement. See LESSHLTHY for more information on the Child Preventive Health Supplement.]]></txt>
